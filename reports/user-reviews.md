### User Review 1 - Michael Young

Notes:
* Asking whether to save as JSON or CSV is unnecessary most of the time, should just default to one of the two.
* Places in Where should be alphabetized.
* Should be more obvious that Match can't search for restaurants, addresses, etc.
* Can only add 1 place at a time.
* Not obvious at all that Match results are clickable.
* Need to scroll down to find places list.
* Search should not default to lat/long, dropdown to change should stand out more.
