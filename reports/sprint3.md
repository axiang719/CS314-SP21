* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is 70%

### Processes
* Incremental development.  No big bangs.
* Main is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests for Main are successful.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics

### Epic One
Epic one will focus on implementing the distance request. We will add "distance" to the list of API features. The user can input locations and get the distance between two endpoints in response.
### Epic Two
Epic two will allow users to calculate distances for thier planned trip, using the earths radius of 3959 miles. This feature will also show distances on the map for adjacent places and forming a "tour" by showing the distance from the last place added to the first. In the history table, users will see the cumalitive distances traveled and the total distance of the tour.
### Epic Three
Epic three will allow users to pick two places from the list, the UI will then place map markers on the user specified location then it will draw a line to connect the markers. The user will also be able to return to their starting location with a press of a button. 
### Epic Four
Epic four will allow users to see a specific place from the trip on the map. When the user clicks on a place in the list, it will be highlighted, and a marker will appear on the map and details about the place will appear in a popup. It will be made obvious to the user via the UI that they can click on places in the trip.

## Review

### Epics completed  
##### Epic One
Epic one allowed our users to send a distance request to our server. We implemented a new API feature which took in a radius and as many places as the user wanted. The user would be sent back a response, where they would see the total distance of thier trip, as well as each individual distance between locations.
##### Epic Two
Epic two entailed the calculation for the distances responses. Using the "vincenty formula" we could properly calculate the distance between any two places on the earth. The Vincenty forumla calculates an angle between two locations which can then be used to calulate an "arclength" which is the distance between two places on a sphere. With these calculations, we updated our API to allow users the funcionality that was promised.
##### Epic Three
Epic three was completed, allowing users to see a "trip line" on the interface map. When users add locations to the trip, a new marker will be set on the map and a line starting at the origin will pass through the marker then returning to the inital location, forming a complete trip. 
##### Epic Four 
Epic four updated the trip table UI allowing users to select specific entries to see on the map. Additional information was added to the trip table, as well as the table being reformatted to be more user friendly. When a user clicks a specific location from the table, the map will zoom and show them the new location.
### Epics not completed 
All epics that were planned got completed by the team. One epic was left in the icebox which we hoped to get to, however it will be moved to next sprint.
## Retrospective
Our team completed the work we set out to and took time to ensure we meat user requirements. Less work was done than on previous sprints, allowing the team to complete tests as well as think about UI updates. 
### Things that went well
One thing that went well for our team was better time management. Previously, we needed to work overtime to push last minute changes that made us work until the last second. THis sprint, we finished what was set out to be done early, giving us time to test our product before our final release.
### Things we need to improve
Communication between team members needs to improve. Often times teammates were stuck or confused on a task given which could have been solved by another teammember. Additionally breaking down large tasks to more managable tasks will help improve our team.
### One thing we will change next time
Communcation will be changed next time. Team members will be encouraged to reach out more often if they are stuck or sitting on a task, in order to keep progress moving. Working as a team is a must if we want to succeed and currently communication is our biggest falter.
