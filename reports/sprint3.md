## Planned Epics

### Epic One
Epic one will focus on implementing the distance request. We will add "distance" to the list of API features. The user can input locations and get the distance between two endpoints in response.
### Epic Two
Epic two will allow users to calculate distances for thier planned trip, using the earths radius of 3959 miles. This feature will also show distances on the map for adjacent places and forming a "tour" by showing the distance from the last place added to the first. In the history table, users will see the cumalitive distances traveled and the total distance of the tour.
### Epic Three
Epic three will allow users to pick two places from the list, the UI will then place map markers on the user specified location then it will draw a line to connect the markers. The user will also be able to return to their starting location with a press of a button. 
### Epic Four
Epic four will allow users to see a specific place from the trip on the map. When the user clicks on a place in the list, it will be highlighted, and a marker will appear on the map and details about the place will appear in a popup. It will be made obvious to the user via the UI that they can click on places in the trip.
