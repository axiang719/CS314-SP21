## Planned Epics

### Epic 1

The first epic will focus on adding team information to the project. The team information will be added to the client applicatoin, browser tab, and server. The changes to the client will update both our team name and number on the title, as well as the footer.

### Epic 2

Epic 2 is the about section, where we will be adding a team image and mission statement, each team member will also add their biography and an image of themselves. All styles and format will stay consistant throughout the team. After completing each task we will reveiw each others work to make sure that everything is correct. 

### Epic 3

Epic 3 will introduce a new trip feature. This will include a list of places that have been clicked, with the newest click showing on the top of the list. In addition to the list, we will implement a clear button to delete all of the list's current entries as well as individual delete buttons to remove an single entry.
