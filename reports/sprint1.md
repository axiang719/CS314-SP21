## Planned Epics

### Epic 1

The first epic will focus on adding team information to the project. The team information will be added to the client applicatoin, browser tab, and server. The changes to the client will update both our team name and number on the title, as well as the footer.

### Epic 2

Epic 2 is the about section, where we will be adding a team image and mission statement, each team member will also add their biography and an image of themselves. All styles and format will stay consistant throughout the team. After completing each task we will reveiw each others work to make sure that everything is correct. 

### Epic 3

Epic 3 will introduce a new trip feature. This will include a list of places that have been clicked, with the newest click showing on the top of the list. In addition to the list, we will implement a clear button to delete all of the list's current entries as well as individual delete buttons to remove an single entry.

## Review

#### Epics completed  
##### Epic One 
In Epic one The Epic Gamers finished putting infomation about the team to the website. We finished the Epic with no problems, the team was able to work as a cohesive unit and complete the assignment in a timely manner. We were also able to decide on a team name after a few minutes of disscusion.
##### Epic Two
In Epic two the team added their mission statement to the website. The team also added infomation about themselves in the form of cards to the website. We added React functionality to the design of the cards and the mission statement button. The functionality included using the components; collapse, card, and button. 
##### Epic Three
In Epic three the team worked on the functionality of the map. We implemented a function which will allow the user to form a list just by taping or clicking on the map. The user could also clear the list with a simple push of a button. While working on implementing the function we struggled with making the table design with react work properly on the website. After many hours of brainstorming and working together we were able to complete the functionality and design of the website ahead of schedule.

#### Epics not completed 
##### Epic Four 
Epic four "Place details" was not finished, but was not planned. This epic has only two associated tasks, one of which uses reverse geocoding to convert latitude and longitude to a text description. Additionally to this, a second task will show additional information about each marker, as well as additional information in the history of clicks. T

##### Epic Five
Epic five "Maps" was not finished, but was not planned. This epic will allow users to have a multitude of new features such as choosing new map backgrounds and saving the map for future sessions. Another new feature will be an added icon on the map that will allow users to select from the list of maps.
