   * I hope we pass.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to learn to work better in a team, I'm more used to working solo. I also need to improve on getting and giving help.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Every student has the right to go above and beyond or the right to choose not to do so. So in other words, yes.

1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__

   * A couple times a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes, unless every other member agrees that the dissenter is being unreasonable (but I doubt it'll come to that, you all seem nice).
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to figure out a compromise that will make everyone happy.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * As long as what they're doing is working, I don't see a problem. Every team needs a leader.

   * I'll politely ask one of my team members to give me a hand.
