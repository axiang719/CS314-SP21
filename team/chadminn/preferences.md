# Preferences for Chad Minning

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It's best to reach me in slack from 8:00am-8:00pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect us to meet project expectations. Hopefully not at the last minute.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I'm hoping to learn to better communicate my own expecations and be more attentive to the expectaions of others.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I tend to like to get things done early and on my own. I'll need to work on having more flexible goals.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would hope that we all do our best to get an 'A'.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * My preference is that everyone would contirbute equally but I understand that that's not always possible.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I anticipate that it will take at least 12 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should communicate to see who's most comfortable or interested in each activity to decide.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should talk to them about the issue first, then go to the professor if it's a persistant problem.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Then we should try to come to an agreement on what is 'A' quality work based on the requirements and past grades.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Try to be understanding first. Have a discussion with them about it if necessary.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * That sounds great.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If possible. At least most of the team should approve otherwise.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to find a compromise if we can. Otherwise go with majority vote.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * We should let them know and give them an opportunity to address that behavior themselves.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I'll have a discussion with my teammates and let them know how I'm feeling.
