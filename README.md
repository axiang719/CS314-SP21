The Epic Gamers are typically available through slack at 3-6 PM (MST) and expect to put forth 10+ hours into the class weekly. Weekly meetings are planned to be held in order to check in with everyone's progress, primarily meeting on tuesdays from 3:30-4:30(MST). Additional meetings may be scheduled on a per need basis. The team is normally available mon-fri, with weekends reserved for other classes unless work is overbearing.  

The team expects people to put in an "A" effort throughout each sprint. Individually team members will hold themselves responsible to ensure they don't drag the team down. Work is expected to be distributed evenly, so no person carries the team. Team members will do their share of the work however they believe will be effective to the teams success. Work should be done ahead of schedule, in order to deliver the best product.

Communication is extremely valuable to the team with the team being extremely open with each other, voicing concerns to each other via slack and discord. Slack will be used for day to day communcation while discord will be used for weekly team meetings. Questions will be brought up to other team members, helping each other out as much as possible.
